<H2>YOUR PRIVACY</H2>

At ProjectAl, we are committed to protecting your privacy. We use the information we collect about you to process orders and to provide a more personalized shopping experience.<br><br> 



When you order, we need to know your name, e-mail address, mailing address, phone number, credit-card number and expiration date. This allows us to process and fulfill your orders and to notify you of your order status. &#8232;You may also voluntarily sign up to be informed about certain offers or updates, which we use to send the information you requested.<br><br>



When you enter a contest or other promotional feature, we may ask for your name, address and e-mail address, and personal preferences, so we can administer the contest and notify winners. We personalize your shopping experience by using your purchases to shape our recommendations about other merchandise that might be of interest to you. We also monitor customer traffic patterns and site usage to help us develop the design and layout of the site.<br><br>



We may also use the information we collect to occasionally notify you about important changes to the Website, new ProjectAl services, and special offers we think you'll find valuable. If you would like to opt-out from receiving ProjectAl emails, please contact Customer Service by emailing customerservice@ProjectAl.com, by managing your email preferences within the "My Account" section of our Website, or by following the unsubscribe instructions in each email.&#8232; 



<H2>YOUR CONSENT&#8232;</H2>



By using our Website, you consent to the collection and use of this information by ProjectAl. If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will post those changes on this page, so you are always aware of what information we collect, how we use it and under what circumstances we disclose it.<br><br>



<H2>HOW DOES PROJECTAL PROTECT CUSTOMER INFORMATION?&#8232;</H2>

We have physical, electronic and procedural security safeguards to protect and secure the information we collect.<br><br>



Our Website uses Secure Sockets Layering (SSL) to encrypt your personal credit information, including your credit card number, before it travels over the Internet. SSL technology is the industry standard for secure online transactions. Because we use SSL, placing an order online at our Website is just as safe as giving your credit card number over the phone.

We are committed to protecting your privacy. We use the information we collect on the site to make shopping at ProjectAl possible and to enhance your overall shopping experience. We DO NOT sell, trade or rent your personal information to others.
