We plan on adding a lot more shirts to the ProjectAl lineup and would like to invite local designers to submit their artwork for these opportunities as they come up.  If we decide to print someone's artwork on a shirt they will receive a percentage of the proceeds for every shirt sold (and maybe some other cool stuff too).  Full credit will be given to every designer as well.  If you are a Minnesota based artist that values our local businesses we would love to have you participate.  Please signup below and we will keep you updated on any future projects.
