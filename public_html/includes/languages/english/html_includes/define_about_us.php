ProjectAl was created by Charley Holden and Derek Hood in order to distract us from our day jobs. Things we like include: design, drinking beer and supporting local businesses & charities. We figured that this project would be a fun way to combine all of these things into something that benefits the Twin Cities community. 

<h2>What does "ProjectAl" mean?</h2>

In the summer of 2009, <a href="http://www.slphistory.org/history/als.asp">Al's Bar</a> was demolished in order to make way for a condo building. The establishment had been around since the 1920's, and over 80 years later it was one of our favorite spots to visit for beers, pull tabs and poor decisions. Al's was a true dive bar, one that had been around so damn long that it had pulled off a legitimate bootlegging operation during prohibition. They were very active in the local community and sponsored countless sports teams (a few of which we were a part of). Although the owner of Al's fared well with the sale of his property, this is rarely the case when independent businesses go under. We decided to create a <span style="color:#00728f;font-weight:bold;">PROJECT</span> that helps people remember to support local landmarks like <span style="color:#00728f;font-weight:bold;">AL</span>'s, in order to keep the corporate chain stores and vacancies away (i.e. things that tend to suck the life and culture out of communities).
