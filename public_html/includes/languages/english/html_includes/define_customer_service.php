<h2>SHIPPING AND DELIVERY</h2>



All domestic orders will be shipped within 1-2 business days via USPS Priority Mail.  You should receive your order within 3-4 days after placing it.

<BR /><BR />

Our flat shipping rate is $4.95 for all U.S. orders, and it doesn't matter how many shirts you order the price will remain the same.  If you order 1 shirt, shipping will cost $4.95 total.  If you ship 20 shirts the price will still be $4.95 total, so feel free to order a higher volume of shirts without worrying about excessive shipping rates.

<BR /><BR />

Please make sure that you are shipping to a secure location and double-check that you entered your address properly.  ProjectAl is not responsible for items shipped to the wrong address as a result of being entered improperly by the customer.

<h2>INTERNATIONAL SHIPPING</h2>



All international orders will be shipped within 1-2 business days.  Most orders will ship global priority and should arrive in 7-14 business days, but in some cases it will take longer and this is out of our control.

<BR /><BR />

Our flat shipping rate for international orders is $15.95 per order.  Your total cost will be $15.95 whether you are shipping 1 shirt or 20 shirts, so your shipping charge will be the same no matter how many shirts you order.  Any VAT or import tariffs are your responsibility to handle.

<BR /><BR />

Please make sure that you are shipping to a secure location and double-check that you entered your address properly.  ProjectAl is not responsible for items shipped to the wrong address as a result of being entered improperly by the customer.

<h2>RETURNS / EXCHANGES</h2>

  

<h3>RETURNS:</h3>  



We don't care what your reason or excuse is, ProjectAl will always be happy to accept returns.  Returns must be made within 14 days of the ship date.  We will not accept returns for shirts that have been worn or washed, so please don't try to pull anything tricky on us. 

<BR /><BR />

Return shipping charges are the responsibility of the customer unless the return is the fault of ProjectAl due to defect or wrongful shipment.  If the return is the fault of ProjectAl, the customer will be reimbursed for the shipping as long as they use a USPS Standard Shipping Method.  Before you ship anything back to us, please e-mail <a href="mailto:orders@ProjectAl.com">orders@ProjectAl.com</a> so we can provide you with complete instructions (please type RETURN in the subject line of your e-mail).

<BR /><BR />

The same information above applies for international returns, but you will have 30 days from the ship date to ship your item back.

<BR /><BR />

<h3>EXCHANGES:</h3>



We want you to be happy with your purchase so we allow exchanges on all orders.  If it's been 14 days or less since the ship date on your order, and you haven't used or washed the shirt, please e-mail <a href="mailto:orders@ProjectAl.com">orders@ProjectAl.com</a> and let us know what you have along with what you would like to exchange it for (type EXCHANGE in the subject line of your e-mail).  We'll provide you with instructions on how to ship the shirt back and will get your new one in the mail as soon as we receive it from you.  We will only honor exchanges for products of equal or lesser value.

<BR /><BR />

The same information above applies to international exchanges, but you will have 60 days from the ship date to return your item.

<BR /><BR />

<h3>SALE ITEMS</h3>



All discounted items are considered final sales unless the item has a defect when you receive it.
